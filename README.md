# Oracle-Practical-Assignment
This is a group assignment to be submitted as per group created for the practical project. The lecturer's permission is required if alone in a group. If permission has not been granted for personal submission, the assignment will not be marked.   Create a folder named by one of the member’s student number (e.g.: Assignment_209040073); include all the oracle forms and report files necessary to complete the assignment. Include a cover sheet for your assignment that includes all members’ initials, surnames and student numbers in a notepad file. Once completed, compress your folder into a single ZIP or RAR file
